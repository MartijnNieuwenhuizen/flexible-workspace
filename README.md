# Flexible Workspace
This is a Prototype for DAMCO to create a flexible prototype.

## Techniques
* Node.js (Express)
* Outlook API integration
* SVG map of the office (or a progressive enhanced solution)

## Branches
I use a lot of Git branches after being inspired to do this by the talk at GitHub Amsterdam. I will test a workflow with a feature branch for every feature. After this project, there will be an article about this workflow on Medium.
